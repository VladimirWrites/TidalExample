* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
* Single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
* Dependency Injection

Built With ðŸ› 
-------
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Kotlin's way of way of writing asynchronous, non-blocking code
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes
  - [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - Allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically
  - [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dependency Injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.

Tested With ðŸ”¬
-------
- [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) - Simple framework to write repeatable tests
- [mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) - Most popular Mocking framework for unit tests
- [mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin) - Provides helper functions to work with Mockito in Kotlin
- [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) - Makes your test assertions and failure messages more readable
- [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) - Runs tests in a simulated Android environment inside a JVM without the overhead of an emulator
- [Fragment Test](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/test) - Helps you run Fragment tests without dependencies on a specific parent activity or fragment
- [Espresso Core](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/) - Helps you write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

To run tests use: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
